### Creating links : We can creat the link by using `<a> </a> `.
> Example : `<a href=" ........." target =" "> Any name</a>`
**we use the href attribute to  write the link. and between the opining and the closing tage we add the name of that link. and if you want to open the link in anew window you just have to use target after href.**

### The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (normal, relative, absolute, fixed).
> Elements can have a positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
> We use `float` to move the content left or right. and we can clear it by using `clear` property.
> Screen Sizes: you can control the size of the screen to qualify many of the devices which have different screen size.

### Function: is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
> `function functionName() {`
   ` function body`
   ` optional return; } `

> calling the function : function functionName( 'Hello');
> in the end you can call the function by `Hello();`
>You can use parameters to calculat variables like 
>`function functionName( high , weidth);`
> var area = high * weidth;
> high and weidth are parameters.

### Pair program benifits:
**It is a technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.**
- pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging.
- pair program it’s often actually more efficient than two people working on separate features. When coming up with ideas and discussing solutions out loud, two programmers may come to a solution faster than one programmer on their own. 
- When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.
- Everyone has a different approach to problem solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of. 
- The ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as important to a company than specific technical skills.
