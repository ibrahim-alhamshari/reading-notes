### Adding Images : you can add image to your web page . The image very helpful way to make the attention of the user and the user can understand about what stands your web for , maybe this image describe and illustrate what theinstructions which is written.

`<img src="......." alt="..." title="....." width="number" height="number" />`
we use the tage `<img>` to add an image , and the `(src=".......")` toput inside it the URL for the image. `(alt="....")` This provides a text description of the image and describe the image if you cannot see it. and we use the `(title="......")` to additional information about the image. and the attributes `(width=" ...."  , heigh ="....")` that specify its size.

### The color : you can use this property to give your pages or your texts a specific colors and that can be by using three ways , which is :rgb values , hex codes, color names.
> - rgb : This way use three parameters to give you a specific color , each parameter (red, green, blue) defines the intensity of the color with a value between 0 and 255. `background-color:(25, 54,154);`

> - hex codes : It consists of six digit codest ,these are six-digit codes represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # `background-color: #ee3eff;`

> - color names : You can by this way only write the name of the color , where there are 147 color are defined, like : white , green , blue and others. `background-color: green;`

### The text : you can change the type of the font(Georgia, Times, Times New Roman, Arial, ......) ,   the style (Normal, Italic, Oblique) ,the weight (Light, Medium, Bold, Black) in additon to that the sizes of text.

### JPEG, PNG and GIF : It is the most common types of images used in websites.

> - JPEG :  It can achieve compression ratios of 1:10 without any perceivable difference in quality.  Because JPEG compression works by averaging out colours of nearby pixels. JPEG images are best suited for photographs and paintings of natural scenes where the variations in colour and intensity are smooth. 

> - PNG : It is a lossless image format using DEFLATE compression. No data is lost during compression and no compression artefacts are introduced in the image. For this reason, a PNG image would retain higher quality than an image than JPEG and would look a lot sharper, it would also occupy more space on the disk. This makes it unsuitable for storing or transferring high-resolution digital photographs but a great choice for images with text, logos and shapes with sharp edges.

> - GIF : GIF images are now mainly used only if the image contains animations.. It is also a lossless image format that uses LZW compression algorithm.  Given that PNG is now supported across all major devices and that PNG compression is about 5â€“25% better than GIF compression,
