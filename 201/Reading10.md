### If a JavaScript statement generates an error, then it throws an exception. At that point, the interpreter stops and looks for exception-handling code.

* " Built-in debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user."
* " With a debugger, you can also set breakpoints (places where code execution can be stopped), and examine variables while the code is executing."
* " The debugger statement stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function."
* " Using the debugger statement has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the code."

**If your statements have errors ,`console` can help you to find your mistake, and you can see your errors in it(`console`) and any type of errors and in any line. the errors can be ( Syntax Error, Ref erenceError,TypeError , Range Error , .......and other errors).**

***NaN : Which means not a number , if you trying to calculate a statement and adding strings to variables .***
