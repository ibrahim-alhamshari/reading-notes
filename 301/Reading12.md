----------  | ------
1. **SQL** databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS) , whereas **NoSQL** database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
2. **SQL** databases have predefined schema whereas **NoSQL** databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
3. **SQL** databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. **NoSQL** databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.
4. **SQL** database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. **NoSQL** database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb.
5. For properties: **SQL** databases emphasizes on ACID properties ( Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) whereas the **NoSQL** database follows the Brewers CAP theorem ( Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance ).

## nosql vs sql

### 1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
- for the complex query intensive environment.

### 2. Give a real world example.
- MySQL Community Edition
### 3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
-  fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

### 4. Give a real world example.
- MongoDB

### 5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
- NoSQL database

### 6. Which type of database is best for scalability?
-  SQL databases



## sql vs nosql (Video)

### 1. What does SQL stand for?
- It's not a database , it stands for structured query language. And it's a language allow you to write database queries.

### 2. What is a realational database?
- the database works in certain way and support sq language (structured query language).

### 3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
- works with tables

### 4. What is a ‘schema’?
- A schema is a collection of database objects including tables, views, triggers. And defined as so-called fields.

### 5. What is a NoSQL database?
- It builded to store a lot of data.

### 6. How does it work?
- we don't have tables but we have so-called documents, they look a bit like JSON. they don't have to use the same schema you can have multiple documents in one collection which have different fields.

### 7. What is inside of a Mongo database?
- different documents in one and the same collection.
### 8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
- MongoDB. because you can easily add a new data.
### 9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
- NoSQL is not a better storage solution.
