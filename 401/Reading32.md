## Serverless

- What is a serverless architecture?
    - A serverless architecture is a way to build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure.

- **Serverless applications**: are event-driven cloud-based systems where application development rely solely on a combination of third-party services, client-side logic and cloud-hosted remote procedure calls (Functions as a Service).

- Why use serverless architectures?
    * By using a serverless architecture, the developers can focus on their core product instead of worrying about managing and operating servers or runtimes, either in the cloud or on-premises. This reduced overhead lets developers reclaim time and energy that can be spent on developing great products which scale and that are reliable.

### GraphQL
- It is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data.
- With it, you define your API using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) and can then use automation to transform it into a fully descriptive cloudformation template that implements the spec.
