# App Monetization
 
> **what is app monetization?**
>- App monetization is the process of converting the app users into revenue.

- This process involves multiple strategies. Some categories of apps are more suited to specific app monetization models than others. Some apps focus on one particular area of app monetization, and others incorporate multiple aspects.

- When we're developing a mobile application for Android and distributing it on Google Play, there are two primary ways we can accept payments: 
1. Google Play's billing system: makes it easy for users to consistently, securely, and seamlessly purchase the goods and services for our apps. Once users save a payment method on Google Play, they can use that same payment method for all future purchases on Google Play with just a tap.

2. Google Pay: It provides the customers a faster, safer way to pay online, both in apps and wherever contactless payments are accepted. Accepting Google Pay speeds up the checkout process, as users won't need to enter their payment details each time or when they first download the app.

- **The following products require developers to use *Google Play's billing system*:**
    1. Virtual game products, such as coins, gems, extra lives or turns.
    2. App functionality or content, such as an ad-free version of an app or new features not available in the free version.
    3. Subscription services, such as streaming media, digital publications, and social networking services.
    4. Cloud software products, including data storage services, business productivity software, and financial management software.

- **Products where we recommend developers use *Google Pay* include the following:**
    1. Retail merchandise, such as groceries, clothing, housewares, and electronics.
    2. Physical services, including taxi and transportation services, cleaning services, food delivery, airfare, and event tickets.
    3. One-time membership fees or recurring dues, including gym memberships, loyalty programs, or clubs offering accessories.
    4. Electronic bill payment, including credit card bills, utilities, and cable or telecommunications services.
