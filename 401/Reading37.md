- Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, and inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites.

- **Advantages of using Amazon S3**
1. Creating buckets – Create and name a bucket that stores data. Buckets are the fundamental containers in Amazon S3 for data storage.

2. Storing data – Store an infinite amount of data in a bucket. Upload as many objects as you like into an Amazon S3 bucket.

3. Downloading data – Download your data or enable others to do so. Download your data anytime you like, or allow others to do the same.

4. Permissions – Grant or deny access to others who want to upload or download data into your Amazon S3 bucket.

5. Standard interfaces – Use standards-based REST and SOAP interfaces designed to work with any internet-development toolkit.

- A **bucket** is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3. Every object is contained in a bucket. For example, if the object named photos/puppy.jpg is stored in the awsexamplebucket1 bucket in the US West (Oregon) Region, then it is addressable using the URL `https://awsexamplebucket1.s3.us-west2.amazonaws.com/photos/puppy.jpg`.
