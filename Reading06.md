### **Problem domain (or problem space) is an engineering term referring to all information that defines the problem and constrains the solution (the constraints being part of the problem).**
**It includes the goals that the problem owner wishes to achieve, the context within which the problem exists, and all rules that define essential functions or other aspects of any solution product. It represents the environment in which a solution will have to operate, as well as the problem itself.**

### The Object : represents one of JavaScript's data types. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. Objects can be created using the Object() .The objects also are variables , but they can contain many values.
> You can creat the object by using var , and this example illustrate how the object seems : `var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};`
> In this example the `firstName` is the key(property) , and `John` is the value of it .

### Caching Dom Queries : When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page. With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document. DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist, which is a collection of nodes.
> Methods return a single element node :
 - getElementByld('Id')
 - querySelector('css selector') 
 -getElementsByClassName('class')

> Selecting an element from a nodelist:
we can use select the elements by using  The Loops with if statement to know if this nodelist have elements or not.
