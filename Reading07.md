### Domain modeling :It is a system of abstractions that describes selected aspects of a sphere of knowledge, influence or activity. The model can then be used to solve problems related to that domain.

### A table is an arrangement of data in rows and columns, or possibly in a more complex structure.
Example : the basic structure of the table
`<table>` : to creat a table
 `<tr>` : The tr stands for table row.
 `<td>` : used to present every cell inside tha row in the table 

**Objects : you can creat the object by using any variable (var , let , const) then the property then the value of this property.**
Example : `const studentDetails = {firstName: '....' ,`
`latestName: '.......' ,`
`age: '....' ,`
`the job: '....' ,`
`.....`
`};`
**You can delete any property by using delete (Object.the-property ) Example :** `delete studentDetails.age`;
**And if you want just to clear the value of the property , you can write no thing inside the necotation** ( `delete studentDetails.age = ' ' ;`)

### The Browser Object Model (BOM) allows JavaScript to "talk to" the browser.
> The window object is supported by all browsers. It represents the browser's window.
Window Size
> Two properties can be used to determine the size of the browser window. Both properties return the sizes in pixels:
- `window.innerHeight` - the inner height of the browser window (in pixels)
- `window.innerWidth` - the inner width of the browser window (in pixels)

> The JavaScript Math object allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers. and here you can see some of these Maths, everyone of these Maths have a specific job.
* Math. ceil ()
* Ma th. floor()
* Math. random()
* Math.floor()
* Math.random()
