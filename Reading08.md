### There are two display values:
- block
- inline.

> Block-level Elements:
* A block-level element always starts on a new line.

* A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

* A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not.
Examples include:` <h1> <p> <ul> <li>`

### Inline Elements
* An inline element does not start on a new line.

* An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

* This is a` <span> `element inside a paragraph.

### The position : It's a property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, absolute, fixed).

> The `float`:  property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.
