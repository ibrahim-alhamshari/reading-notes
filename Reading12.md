### A chart:  Is a graphical representation for data visualization, in which "the data is represented by symbols, such as bars in a bar chart, lines in a line chart, or slices in a pie chart". A chart can represent tabular numeric data, functions or some kinds of quality structure and provides different info.


**`<canvas>` element is used to draw graphics, and that's done by JavaScript. `<canvas id=" "width="150" height="150"></canvas>` .It support the shapes :rectangles and paths (lists of points connected by lines). and If we want to apply colors to a shape, there are two important properties we can use: *fillStyle* and *strokeStyle*.**

>If we want to render the text ; there are two methods to do that:
- 1- fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
- 2- strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])

> And we can adjust the text by using these properties:
* font = value
* textAlign = value
* textBaseline = value
* direction = value
