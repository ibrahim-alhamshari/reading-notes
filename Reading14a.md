### Group norms : Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards that adjust how we deal when we work together. Where avoiding the disagreement is more valuable than debate. where if we  avoid any debate that will lead us to be closer to the success.

### The right norms could raise a groupâ€™s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if individually, all the members were exceptionally clever.

### The `transform` property applies a **2D** or **3D** transformation to an element. This property allows you to *rotate, scale, move, skew*, etc., elements.

> Examples:
> - `transform: scale(1.5);` ===> when you hover the element, the area or the volum will increase by 1.5  
> - `transform: rotate(20deg);`===> when you hover the element, it will rotate to 20 degree only.
> - `transform: scale(.5, 1.15);` ===> This will change the element's shap, where it will shrink from x-axis by 0.5 ,  and increase from y-axis by1.15 .
> - `transform: skewX(5deg);` ===> Will make an oblique to the element.
> - `transform: perspective(200px)` ===> It give the object value to far this object is away from the user.

### `transitions` allows us to change property values smoothly, over a given duration. And there are four properties related to it :`transition-property`, `transition-duration`, `transition-timing-function` and `transition-delay`.

### `animation` move the element with number of iterations in a specific way , It used mostly with `transition` to make the element more controlled. We use `@keyframes` to set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition.
