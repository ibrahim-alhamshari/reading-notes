> Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also 
helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized. 
Good navigation tends to follow these principles.

> A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key 
information that needs to go on each page of a 
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information 
and how much space it might required.


> The primary aim of any kind of visual design 
is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing 
information on a page helps users understand 
its importance and what order to read it in.

> HTML5 allows web page authors 
to place an < a > element around 
a block level element that 
contains child elements. This 
allows you to turn an entire block 
into a link.
This is not a new element in 
HTML5, but it was not seen as a 
correct usage of the < a > element 
in earlier versions of HTML.
